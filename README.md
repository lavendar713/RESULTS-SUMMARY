## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I usually had struggles getting my websites to fit into the device screen, there was always some sort of overflow. During the course of working on this, I decided to get to the root cause of it and I realizeed it was because i unknowingly set the width of each div thereby giving the browser a certain width to stick to. Lesson Learnt.
